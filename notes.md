**code isnt fully done** **(planning to fix it all and work on it more once the stuff comes)**, i tried to find cheap parts for the case and screen **(most weren't compatible)** but i could not find anything cheaper that matched my project, i used compatible parts and am planning to run local ai on it hence the 8 gb, once i get it i will attempt, **it is a home ai like an alexa**, tried to keep this within a reasonable range without using up all of the budget, i also spent around 7 hours coding and researching for this project so pls approve.


needs.
16 gb raspberry pi to run 30b quantized model, cooling fan so it doesnt overheat, microphone for the actual functionality of the ai, to speak to it, speaker so it can output audio, charger for the raspberry pi, microsd card for storage (128 gb) so the models can be downloaded etc, case and screen so you can view the raspberry pi, and so it can be propped up on a desk and used as an alexa.
