**code isnt fully done** **(planning to fix it all and work on it more once the stuff comes)**, i tried to find cheap parts for the case and screen **(most weren't compatible)** but i could not find anything cheaper that matched my project, i used compatible parts and am planning to run local ai on it hence the 8 gb, once i get it i will attempt, **it is a home ai like an alexa**, tried to keep this within a reasonable range without using up all of the budget, i also spent around 7 hours coding and researching for this project so pls approve.
